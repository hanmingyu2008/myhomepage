# Learning and Possible Research Interest in Future

## Learning Inerest
For the learning part, I'm going to list many courses I've learned in various fields, and are useful for the future research.The following are the fields to be included.

* [Computational Mathematics](ComputMath.md)
* [Statistics and Financial Mathematics](StaFinMath.md)

* [Basic Computer Skills](ComputerBasic.md)
* [Advanced Computer Skills](Computer.md)
* [Advanced Computing Technology](AdvancedComp.md)
* [Artificial Intelligence](ArtiIntell.md)

## Future Research Interest

I'm now interested in Computational Mathematics, and those traditional Numerical Methods developed to solve Differential Equations generated from physical and engineering problems. However, I discovered that, 
under the overwhelming developing of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this traditional field and subject with a not long
 history is about to disappear. So I have to prepare to leave from this field, which I deeply love.

In my long-time discovering and seeking, I found that I might be interested in fields behind:

* [Scientific Machine Learning](SML.md)
* [High Performance Computing](HPC.md)
* [Computer Graphics and Physical Simulation](CGPS.md)
* [Computational Engineering](CE.md)
* [Quantum Computing](QC.md)
* [Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](MLAI.md)

However, I haven't even dive deeply into even one of those subjects to take a quick glimpse into its beauty.
 This means that I might not be really ready to study and research at least at present. In fact, I will always be on the stage of learning those frontier techniques.
