# Possible Furture Research Interest

I'm now interested in Computational Mathematics, and those traditional Numerical Methods developed to solve Differential Equations generated from physical and engineering problems. However, I discovered that, 
under the overwhelming developing of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this traditional field and subject with a not long
 history is about to disappear. So I have to prepare to leave from this field, which I deeply love.

In my long-time discovering and seeking, I found that I might be interested in fields behind:

* [Scientific Machine Learning](SML.md)
* [High Performance Computing](HPC.md)
* [Computer Graphics and Physical Simulation](CGPS.md)
* [Computational Engineering](CE.md)
* [Quantum Computing](QC.md)
* [Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence](MLAI.md)

However, I haven't even dive deeply into even one of those subjects to take a quick glimpse into its beauty.
 This means that I might not be really ready to study and research at least at present.
