# Courses I've learned and Knowledge I've acquired

In this page, I wish I could briefly summarize those knowledge and resources I acquired during study.

Remark: I never wish to teach anyone anything through this page. What I want to do is to help those who wants to be remind of these things after taking those courses for a long time, or to quickly get a limpse into these fields to meet the demand of their own field.
